      <h1>Info</h1>
      <h3>Start</h3>
      <p>
        The first thing to do is to buy Mining Drones and Crystal Drones and
        Technicians as needed. Than you should buy an Energy Plant to be able to
        get more Technician. Than buy some Computing Unit, Research tab will
        appear. Unused computing will be converted to Research, research
        Corvette and you will be ready to start battle.
      </p>
      <h3>Fleet</h3>
      <p>
        In the ruler-pencil tab you can reinforce your fleet and make new ship
        design. For now just drag the Corvette slider to max and click Reinforce
        fleet. You must have Foundry Drones and Worker Drones to complete the
        job.
      </p>
      <h3>Ship Design</h3>
      <p>
        You can create and modify ships design. Ships have this specifications:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Armor: health, you now</li>
        <li>Shield: take damage before Armor</li>
        <li>Energy: must be positive, has no effect in battle</li>
        <li>Damage: average damage, see modules for more info</li>
        <li>
          Explosion Chance: the armor threshold where your ship may explode
          (lower is better)
        </li>
        <li>Price: price of one ship in Alloy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ships design are a list of modules, bigger ships can have more modules.
        Design are limited by module count and module points, module can have
        different size and bigger size cost more points.
      </p>
      Weapons:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          Laser: starting weapon, anti armor, 75% vs shield, 125% vs armor
        </li>
        <li>Plasma: anti armor, 30% vs shield, 170% vs armor</li>
        <li>Mass Driver: anti shield, 125% vs shield, 75% vs armor</li>
        <li>Gauss rifle: anti shield, 170% vs shield, 30% vs armor</li>
      </ul>
      Energy:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Solar Panel: cheap and doesn't increase explosion chance</li>
        <li>
          RTG: give more energy but cost more and increase explosion chance
        </li>
        <li>
          Fusion Reactor: give even more energy but is more expensive and
          increase explosion chance
        </li>
      </ul>
      Defense:
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Armor: basic defense, doesn't consume energy</li>
        <li>Shield: take damage before armor, consume energy</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Battle</h3>
      <p>
        Battle calculate every ship individually, so if you have 1000 ships 1000
        will be simulated. Battle consist of up to five rounds, fleets start
        with maximum armor and shields. In each round, all participating units
        randomly choose a target enemy unit.
        <br />
        For each weapon of each ship:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>
          If the damage * shield percent is lower than 0.1% of target shield no
          damage is done.
        </li>
        <li>
          Enemy shield get damaged, than if shield is zero damage is done to
          Armor (with armor damage percent of the weapon)
        </li>
        <li>
          If target armor percent is less than 100% - target Explosion Chance
          there is a chance that target explode (armor set to -1; can still be
          shot by the other units on this round)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Death units are removed and a new round start. Note tha explosion chance
        is calculated on each shot and ships may waste attacks of exploded
        ships. Finally if one side has ero ships the other wins. Enemy do not
        rebuild ships.
      </p>
      <h3>Enemy</h3>
      <p>
        Every enemy come with 100 cells. Some cells will give you habitable
        space or mining districts. You can search fo new enemy in the search
        tab, after defeating an enemy the next is auto attacked. Enemy of higher
        level yields more districts and Dark Matter. Max level for enemy is max
        level defeated +1
      </p>
      <h3>Prestige</h3>
      <p>
        Prestige tab is unlocked by completely defeated the first enemy (all 100
        cells). Prestige will give you Skill point based on max enemy level. Do
        get more Skills you will need to defeat higher level enemy. By defeating
        enemy of level >=2 you will gain Inactive Dark Matter, prestige activate
        the Dark Matter. Dark Matter can be used to time warp.
      </p>
      <h3>Drone Factory and Modding</h3>
      <p>
        Robot Factory is a structure that make robots, robots will automatically
        available jobs (mining, technicians...) based on percent of missing
        worker and the priority bar.<br />
        Drone modding allows you to customize your Drones. You will get mod
        point by completing Drone Modding research.
