<h1>Fleet</h1>
<p>
  In the cog tab you can reinforce your fleet and make new ship design. For now
  just drag the Corvette slider to max and click Reinforce fleet. You must have
  Foundry Drones and Worker Drones to complete the job.
</p>
<h3>Ship Design</h3>
<p>
  You can create and modify ships design. Ships have those specifications:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Armor: health, you now</li>
  <li>Shield: take damage before Armor</li>
  <li>Energy: must be positive, has no effect in battle</li>
  <li>Damage: average damage, see modules for more info</li>
  <li>
    Explosion Chance: the armor threshold where your ship may explode (lower is
    better)
  </li>
  <li>Price: price of one ship in Alloy</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Ships designs are a list of modules, bigger ships can have more modules.
  Designs are limited by module count and module points. Modules can have
  different sizes, Larger sizes cost more points.
</p>
<h6>Weapons</h6>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    Laser: starting weapon, anti armor, 75% vs shield, 125% vs armor
  </li>
  <li>Plasma: anti armor, 30% vs shield, 170% vs armor</li>
  <li>Mass Driver: anti shield, 125% vs shield, 75% vs armor</li>
  <li>Gauss rifle: anti shield, 170% vs shield, 30% vs armor</li>
</ul>
<h6>Energy</h6>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Solar Panel: cheap and doesn't increases explosion chance</li>
  <li>
    RTG: gives more energy but cost more and increases explosion chance
  </li>
  <li>
    Fusion Reactor: gives even more energy but is more expensive and increase
    explosion chance
  </li>
</ul>
<h6>Defense</h6>
<ul class="list">
  <li>Armor: basic defense, doesn't consume energy</li>
  <li>Shield: take damage before armor, consume energy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Battle</h3>
<p>
  Battle calculate every ship individually, so if you have 1000 ships 1000 will
  be simulated. Battle consist of up to five rounds, fleets start with maximum
  armor and shields. In each round, all participating units randomly choose a
  target enemy unit.
  <br />
  For each weapon of each ship:
</p>
<ul class="list">
  <li>
    If the damage * shield percent is lower than 0.1% of target shield no damage
    is done.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enemy shield get damaged, than if shield is zero damage is done to Armor
    (with armor damage percent of the weapon)
  </li>
  <li>
    If target armor percent is less than 100% - target Explosion Chance there is
    a chance that target explode (armor set to -1; can still be shot by the
    other units on this round)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Death units are removed and a new round start. Note tha explosion chance is
  calculated on each shot and ships may waste attacks of exploded ships. Finally
  if one side has ero ships the other wins. Enemy do not rebuild ships.
</p>
<h3>Planetary Defense</h3>
<p>
  From level 9 enemy will have planetary defenses in addition to regular fleets.
  In battler Planetary Defense work exactly like fleets. Planetary defense can
  also be destroyed by your Missiles. Missiles are unlocked with a research. You
  can manually nuke or use the Auto Nuke options. Nuke will use the minimum
  number of missile to destroy all enemy defenses, if the nuke button is green
  you have enoughs missile to destroy all enemy defenses.
