<h1>Laboratory</h1>
<p>
  In the Laboratory you can research and improve new technologies. Research is
  generated by unused computing power. Researches in the "In Progress" column
  are researched, those in the "Backlog" not.

<h3>Starting research</h3>
<p>What to focus when starting:</p>
<ul class="list">

    <strong>Better Researching:</strong> The first level can boost your research
    progress

    <strong>Energy:</strong> You probably want more energy, so get some level of
    this
  </li>
  <li>
